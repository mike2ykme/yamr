YAMR: Yet another Mongo Reactive project

This is nothing more than me playing around with reactive Spring 
along with MongoDB and seeing how I can break and fix things to do what I want.
I'll try and additionally document where I find things in each of the files so in the 
future if I'm trying to understand why I did something I'll be able to look back at it.
